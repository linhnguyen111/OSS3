## Contributing
Please submit bug reports, suggestions and pull requests to the  [GitHub issue tracker](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

We're particularly interested in fixing edge-cases, expanding test coverage and updating translations.

If you found a mistake in the docs, or want to add something, go ahead and amend the wiki - anyone can edit it.

If you have git clones from prior to the move to the PHPMailer GitHub organisation, you'll need to update any remote URLs referencing the old GitHub location with a command like this from within your clone:
``` 
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer.git 
```
Please *don't* use the SourceForge or Google Code projects any more; they are obsolete and no longer maintained.

## Sponsorship
Development time and resources for PHPMailer are provided by [Smartmessages.net](https://info.smartmessages.net/), a powerful email marketing system.
